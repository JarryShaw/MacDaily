About
-----

Package day-care manager on macOS.

``macdaily`` is a mediate collection of console scripts written in
**Python** and **Bourne-Again Shell**. Originally works as an automatic
housekeeper for Mac to update all packages outdated, ``macdaily`` is now
fully functioned and end-user oriented. Without being aware of
everything about your Mac, one can easily work around and manage
packages out of no pain using ``macdaily``.

Installation
------------

Just as many Python packages, ``macdaily`` can be installed through
``pip`` using the following command, which will get you the latest
version from `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__.

.. code:: shell

    pip install macdaily

Or if you prefer the real-latest version and fetch from this Git
repository, then the script below should be used.

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/JarryShaw/macdaily.git
    cd macdaily
    pip install -e .
    # and to update at any time
    git pull

And for tree format support in dependency command, you may need
``pipdeptree``, then implicitly you can use the following script to do
so.

.. code:: shell

    pip install macdaily[pipdeptree]
    # or explicitly...
    pip install macdaily pipdeptree

Do please **NOTE** that, ``macdaily`` runs only with support of Python
from version **3.4** and on. And it shall only work ideally on
**macOS**.

Configuration
-------------

    This part might be kind of garrulous, for some may not know what's
    going on here. ðŸ˜‰

Since robust enough, ``macdaily`` now supports configuration upon
user's own wish. One may set up log path, hard disk path, archive path
and many other things, other than the default settings.

   **NOTA BENE** -- ``macdaily`` now supports configuration commands,
   see `Config
   Procedure <https://github.com/JarryShaw/MacDaily/tree/master/src#config>`__
   section for more information.

The configuration file should lie under ``~/.dailyrc``, which is hidden
from Finder by macOS. To review or edit it, you may use text editors
like ``vim`` and/or ``nano``, or other graphic editors, such as
``Sublime Text`` and/or ``Atom``, or whatever you find favourable.

.. code:: ini

    [Path]
    # In this section, paths for log files are specified.
    # Please, under any circumstances, make sure they are valid.
    logdir = ~/Library/Logs/MacDaily    ; path where logs will be stored
    tmpdir = /tmp/dailylog              ; path where temporary runtime logs go
    dskdir = /Volumes/Your Disk         ; path where your hard disk lies
    arcdir = ${dskdir}/Developers       ; path where ancient logs archive

    # If you would like to disable the mode, set it to "false".

        22:30-update        ; update at 22:30
        23:00-logging       ; logging at 23:00

    [Option]
    # In this section, command options are picked.
    # Do make sure these options are available for commands.
    update  = --all --yes --pre --quiet --show-log --no-cask
    logging = --all --quiet --show-log

Above is the default content of ``.dailyrc``, following the grammar of
``INI`` files. Lines and words after number sign (``'#'``) and semicolon
(``';'``) are comments, whose main purpose is to help understanding the
contents of this file.

In section ``[Path]``, there are path names where logs and some other
things to be stored. In section ``[Mode]``, there are ten different
modes to indicate if they are *enabled* or *disabled* when calling from
``--all`` option.

You may wish to set the ``dskdir`` -- *path where your hard disk lies*,
which allows ``macdaily`` to archive your ancient logs and caches into
somewhere never bothers.

Please **NOTE** that, under all circumstances, of section ``[Path]``,
all values would better be a **valid path name without blank
characters** (``\t\n\r\f\v``), except your hard disk ``dskdir``.

Besides, in section ``[Daemon]``, you can decide which command is
scheduled and when to run such command, with the format of
``HH:MM[-CMD]``. The ``CMD`` is optional, which will be ``any`` if
omits. And you may setup which command(s) will be registered as daemons
and run with schedule through six booleans above. These boolean values
help ``macdaily`` indicate which is to be launched when commands in
``schedule`` omit. That is to say, when ``command`` omits in
``schedule``, ``macdaily`` will register all commands that set ``true``
in the above boolean values.

Also, in section ``[Option]``, you may set up optional arguments for
the daemons above. Do please make sure these commands are **valid**. And
if omit, an empty arguments will be given.

Last but no least, in section ``[Account]``, you should **NEVER**
modify any contents under this section in order to keep ``macdaily``
working. However, you may setup this part with ``config`` command.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Where can I find the log files?

   It depends. Since the path where logs go can be modified through
   ``~/.dailyrc``, it may vary as your settings. In default, you may
   find them under ``~/Library/Logs/Scripts``. And with every command,
   logs can be found in its corresponding folder. Logs are named after
   its running time, in the fold with corresponding date as its name.

   Note that, normally, you can only find today's logs in the folder,
   since ``macdaily`` automatically archive ancient logs into
   ``${logdir}/archive`` folder. And every week, ``${logdir}/archive``
   folder will be tape-archived into ``${logdir}/tarfile``. Then after a
   month, and your hard disk available, they will be moved into
   ``/Volumes/Your Disk/Developers/archive.zip``.

2. What if my hard disk ain't plugged-in when running the scripts?

   Then the archiving and removing procedure will **NOT** perform. In
   case there might be some useful resources of yours.

3. Which directory should I set in the configuration file?

   First and foremost, I highly recommend you **NOT** to modify the
   paths in ``~/.dailyrc`` manually, **EXCEPT** your disk path
   ``dskdir``.

   But if you insist to do so, then make sure they are **VALID** and
   **available** with permission granted, and most importantly, have
   **NO** blank characters (``\t\n\r\f\v``) in the path, except
   ``dskdir``.

TODO
----

- support configuration

- support command aliases

- reconstruct archiving procedure

- support ``gem`` and ``npm`` in all commands

- optimise ``KeyboardInterrupt`` handling procedure

- review ``pip`` implementation and version indication

- considering support more versions of Python
