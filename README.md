## About

 > Just some useful daily utility scripts.

&emsp; `jsdaily` is a mediate collection of console scripts written in __Python__ and __Bourne-Again Shell__. Originally works as an automatic housekeeper for one's Mac, which should update all packages outdated, `jsdaily` is now fully functioned and end-user oriented. Without being aware of everything about your Mac, one can easily work around and manage packages out of no pain using `jsdaily`.

&nbsp;

<a name="install"> </a>

## Installation

&emsp; As of many Python packages, `jsdaily` can install through `pip` with the following command, which will get you the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

```
$ pip install jsdaily
```

&emsp; Or if you prefer the real-latest version, fetch from this Git repository, then the script below should be used.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JarryShaw/jsdaily.git
$ python setup.py install
```

&emsp; Do please __NOTE__ that, `jsdaily` runs only with support of Python from version ***3.6*** and on. And it shall only work ideally on ***macOS***.

&nbsp;

<a name="config"> </a>

## Configuration

 > This part might be kind of garrulous, some users may not know what's going on here. :wink:

&emsp; Since robust enough, `jsdaily` now supports configuration upon user's own wish. One may set up log path, hard disk path, archive path and many other things, other than the default settings.

&emsp; The configuration file should be stored under `~/.dailyrc`, which is hidden from Finder by macOS. To review or edit it, you may use text editors like `vim` and `nano`, or other graphic editors, such as `Sublime Text` and `Atom`, or whatever you find favourable.

```
[Path]
# In this section, paths for log files are specified.
# Please, under any circumstances, make sure they are valid.
logdir = /Library/Logs/Scripts      ; path where logs will be stored
tmpdir = /tmp/log                   ; path where temporary runtime logs go
dskdir = /Volumes/Your Disk         ; path where your hard disk lies
arcdir = ${dskdir}/Developers       ; path where ancient logs archive

[Mode]
# In this section, flags for modes are configured.
# If you would like to disable the mode, set it to "false".
apm      = true     ; Atom packages
gem      = true     ; Ruby gems
npm      = true     ; Node.js modules
pip      = true     ; Python packages
brew     = true     ; Homebrew Cellars
cask     = true     ; Caskroom Casks
dotapp   = true     ; Applications (*.app)
macapp   = true     ; applications in /Application folder
cleanup  = true     ; cleanup caches
appstore = true     ; Mac App Store applications
```

&emsp; Above is the content of `.dailyrc`, following the grammar of `INI` files. Lines and words after number sign (`'#'`) and semicolon (`';'`) are comments, whose main purpose is to help understanding the contents of this file.

&emsp; In section `[Path]`, there are path names where logs and some other things to be stored. In section `[Mode]`, there are ten different modes to indicate if they are *enabled* or *disabled* in default.

&emsp; You may wish to set the `dskdir` -- *path where your hard disk lies*, which allows `jsdaily` to archive your ancient logs and caches into somewhere never bothers.

&emsp; Please __NOTE__ that, under all circumstances, of section `[Path]`, all values would better be a ***valid path name without blank characters*** (`' \t\n\r\f\v'`), except your hard disk `dskdir`.

## Usage Manual

<a name="startup"> </a>

### Start-Up

&emsp; Before we dive into the usage of `jsdaily`, let's firstly get our hands dirty with some simple commands.

 > __NOTE__ -- all acronyms and aliases are left out for a quick and clear view of `jsdaily`

1. How to update all outdated packages?

    ```
    $ jsdaily update --all
    ```

2. How to update a certain package (eg: `hello` from Homebrew) ?

    ```
    $ jsdaily update brew --package hello
    ```

3. How to uninstall a certain package along with its dependencies (eg: `pytest` from brewed CPython version 3.6) ?

    ```
    $ jsdaily uninstall pip --brew --cpython --python_version 3 --package pytest
    ```

4. How to reinstall all packages but do not cleanup caches?

    ```
    $ jsdaily reinstall --all --no-cleanup
    ```

5. How to postinstall packages whose name ranges between "start" and "stop" alphabetically?

    ```
    $ jsdaily postinstall --all --startwith start --endwith stop
    ```

6. How to show dependency of a certain package as a tree (eg: `gnupg` from Homebrew) ?

    ```
    $ jsdaily dependency brew --package gnupg --tree
    ```

7. How to log all applications on my Mac, a.k.a. `*.app` files?

    ```
    $ jsdaily logging dotapp
    ```

8. How to run `jsdaily` in quiet mode, i.e. with no output information (eg: `logging` in quiet mode) ?

    ```
    $ jsdaily logging --all --quiet
    ```

<a name="command"> </a>

### Commands

&emsp; `jsdaily` supports several different commands, from `update`, `unisntall`, `reinstall` and `postinstall` to `dependency` and `logging`. Of all commands, there are corresponding **aliases** for which to be reckoned as valid.

| Command       | Aliases                         |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| `update`      | `up`, `U`, `upgrade`            |
| `uninstall`   | `un`, `remove`, `rm`, `r`, `un` |
| `reinstall`   | `re`, `R`                       |
| `postinstall` | `post`, `ps`, `p`               |
| `dependency`  | `deps`, `dep`, `dp`, `de`, `d`  |
| `logging`     | `log`, `lg`, `l`                |

&emsp; And the man page of `jsdaily` shows as below.

```
$ jsdaily --help
usage: jsdaily [-h] command

Package Day Care Manager

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -V, --version  show program's version number and exit

Commands:
  jsdaily provides a friendly CLI workflow for the administrator of macOS to
  manipulate packages
```

<a name="update"> </a>

### Update Procedure

&emsp; The `update` command will automatically update all outdated packages installed through --

 - `apm` -- [Atom](https://atom.io) plug-ins
 - `gem` -- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) gems
 - `npm` -- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) modules
 - `pip` -- Python packages, in both version of 2.\* and 3.\*, running under [CPython](https://www.python.org) or [PyPy](https://pypy.org) compiler, and installed through `brew` or official disk images (`*.dmg`)
 - `brew` -- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulae
 - `cask` -- [Caskroom](https://caskroom.github.io) binaries
 - `appstore` -- Mac App Store or `softwareupdate` installed applications

and an additional `cleanup` procedure, which prunes and deduplicates files, archives and removes caches. The man page of `update` shows as below.

```
$ jsdaily update --help

  -f, --force    run in force mode, only for Homebrew or Caskroom
  -m, --merge    run in merge mode, only for Homebrew
  -g, --greedy   run in greedy mode, only for Caskroom
  -r, --restart  automatically restart if necessary, only for App Store
  -Y, --yes      yes for all selections, only for pip
  -q, --quiet    run in quiet mode, with no output information
  -v, --verbose  run in verbose mode, with detailed output information

                 alternatively and simply, cleanup

aliases: update, up, U, upgrade
```

&emsp; Note that disabled modes in configuration file `.dailyrc` will not update under any circumstances. To update all packages, use one of the commands below.

```
$ jsdaily update -a

```

<a name="update_apm"> </a>

1. `apm` -- Atom Plug-In

## Troubleshooting

1. Where can I find the log files?

    &emsp; It depends. Since the path where logs go can be modified through `~/.dailyrc`, it may vary as your settings. In default, you may find them under `/Library/Logs/Scripts`. And with every command, logs can be found in its corresponding folder. Logs are named after its running time, in the fold with corresponding date as its name.

    &emsp; Note that, normally, you can only find today's logs in the folder, since `jsdaily` automatically archive ancient logs into `./archive` folder. And every week, `./archive` folder will be tape-archived into `./tarfile`. Then after a month, and your hard disk available, they will be moved into `/Volumes/Your Diks/Developers/archive.zip`.

2. What if my hard disk ain't plugged-in when running the scripts?

    &emsp; Then the archiving and removing procedure will __NOT__ perform. In case, there might be some useful resources of you.

3. Which directory should I set in the configuration file?

    &emsp; First and foremost, I highly recommend you __NOT__ to modify the paths in `~/.dailyrc`, __EXCEPT__ your disk path `dskdir`.

    &emsp; But if you insist to do so, then make sure they are __VALID__ and ***available*** with permission granted, and most importantly, have __NO__ blank characters (`' \t\n\r\f\v'`) in the path, except `dskdir`.
