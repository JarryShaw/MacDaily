## About

 > Package day-care manager on macOS.

&emsp; `macdaily` is a mediate collection of console scripts written in __Python__ and __Bourne-Again Shell__. Originally works as an automatic housekeeper for Mac to update all packages outdated, `macdaily` is now fully functioned and end-user oriented. Without being aware of everything about your Mac, one can easily work around and manage packages out of no pain using `macdaily`.

&nbsp;

<a name="install"> </a>

## Installation

&emsp; Just as many Python packages, `macdaily` can be installed through `pip` using the following command, which will get you the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

```sh
pip install macdaily
```

&emsp; Or if you prefer the real-latest version and fetch from this Git repository, then the script below should be used.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JarryShaw/macdaily.git
cd macdaily
pip install -e .
# and to update at any time
git pull
```

&emsp; And for tree format support in dependency command, you may need `pipdeptree`, then implicily you can use the following script to do so.

```sh
pip install macdaily[pipdeptree]
# or explicitly...
pip install macdaily pipdeptree
```

&emsp; Do please __NOTE__ that, `macdaily` runs only with support of Python from version ***3.6*** and on. And it shall only work ideally on ***macOS***.

&nbsp;

<a name="configuration"> </a>

## Configuration

 > This part might be kind of garrulous, for some may not know what's going on here. :wink:

&emsp; Since robust enough, `macdaily` now supports configuration upon user's own wish. One may set up log path, hard disk path, archive path and many other things, other than the default settings.

 > __NOTA BENE__ -- `macdaily` now supports configuration commands, see [Config Procedure](https://github.com/JarryShaw/MacDaily/tree/master/src#config) section for more information.

&emsp; The configuration file should lie under `~/.dailyrc`, which is hidden from Finder by macOS. To review or edit it, you may use text editors like `vim` and/or `nano`, or other graphic editors, such as `Sublime Text` and/or `Atom`, or whatever you find favourable.

```
[Path]
# In this section, paths for log files are specified.
# Please, under any circumstances, make sure they are valid.
logdir = ~/Library/Logs/MacDaily    ; path where logs will be stored
tmpdir = /tmp/dailylog              ; path where temporary runtime logs go
dskdir = /Volumes/Your Disk         ; path where your hard disk lies
arcdir = ${dskdir}/Developers       ; path where ancient logs archive

[Mode]
# In this section, flags for modes are configured.
# If you would like to disable the mode, set it to "false".
apm      = true     ; Atom packages
gem      = true     ; Ruby gems

postinstall = false     ; don't run postinstall

logging     = true      ; run logging on schedule
schedule    =           ; scheduled timing (in 24 hours)
    8:00                ; update & logging at 8:00
    22:30-update        ; update at 22:30
    23:00-logging       ; logging at 23:00

[Option]
# In this section, command options are picked.
# Do make sure these options are available for commands.
update  = --all --yes --pre --quiet --show-log --no-cask
logging = --all --quiet --show-log

[Account]
# In this section, account information are stored.
# You must not modify this part under any circumstances.
username = ...
password = ********

[Environment]
# In this section, environment specifications are set up.
# Please, under any circumstances, make sure all fields are valid.
bash-timeout = 1_000    ; timeout limit for each shell script in seconds
sudo-timeout = 5m       ; sudo command timeout as specified in /etc/sudoers
```

&emsp; Above is the default content of `.dailyrc`, following the grammar of `INI` files. Lines and words after number sign (`'#'`) and semicolon (`';'`) are comments, whose main purpose is to help understanding the contents of this file.

&emsp; In section `[Path]`, there are path names where logs and some other things to be stored. In section `[Mode]`, there are ten different modes to indicate if they are *enabled* or *disabled* when calling from `--all` option.

&emsp; You may wish to set the `dskdir` -- *path where your hard disk lies*, which allows `macdaily` to archive your ancient logs and caches into somewhere never bothers.

&emsp; Please __NOTE__ that, under all circumstances, of section `[Path]`, all values would better be a ***valid path name without blank characters*** (` \t\n\r\f\v`), except your hard disk `dskdir`.

&emsp; Besides, in section `[Daemon]`, you can decide which command is scheduled and when to run such command, with the format of `HH:MM[-CMD]`. The `CMD` is optional, which will be `any` if omits. And you may setup which command(s) will be registered as daemons and run with schedule through six booleans above. These boolean values help `macdaily` indicate which is to be launched when commands in `schedule` omit. That is to say, when `command` omits in `schedule`, `macdaily` will register all commands that set `true` in the above boolean values.

&emsp; Also, in section `[Option]`, you may set up optional arguments for the daemons above. Do please make sure these commands are **valid**. And if omit, an empty arguments will be given.

&emsp; Last but no least, in section `[Account]`, you should **NEVER** modify any contents under this section in order to keep `macdaily` working. However, you may setup this part with [`config`](https://github.com/JarryShaw/MacDaily/tree/master/src#config) command.

## Troubleshooting

1. Where can I find the log files?

    &emsp; It depends. Since the path where logs go can be modified through `~/.dailyrc`, it may vary as your settings. In default, you may find them under `~/Library/Logs/Scripts`. And with every command, logs can be found in its corresponding folder. Logs are named after its running time, in the fold with corresponding date as its name.

    &emsp; Note that, normally, you can only find today's logs in the folder, since `macdaily` automatically archive ancient logs into `${logdir}/archive` folder. And every week, `${logdir}/archive` folder will be tape-archived into `${logdir}/tarfile`. Then after a month, and your hard disk available, they will be moved into `/Volumes/Your Diks/Developers/archive.zip`.

2. What if my hard disk ain't plugged-in when running the scripts?

    &emsp; Then the archiving and removing procedure will __NOT__ perform. In case there might be some useful resources of yours.

3. Which directory should I set in the configuration file?

    &emsp; First and foremost, I highly recommend you __NOT__ to modify the paths in `~/.dailyrc` manually, __EXCEPT__ your disk path `dskdir`.

    &emsp; But if you insist to do so, then make sure they are __VALID__ and ***available*** with permission granted, and most importantly, have __NO__ blank characters (` \t\n\r\f\v`) in the path, except `dskdir`.

&nbsp;

<a name="todo"> </a>

## TODO

 - [x] support configuration
 - [x] support command aliases
 - [x] reconstruct archiving procedure
 - [ ] support `gem` and `npm` in all commands
 - [x] optimise `KeyboardInterrupt` handling procedure
 - [ ] review `pip` implementation and version indication
 - [x] considering support more versions of Python
