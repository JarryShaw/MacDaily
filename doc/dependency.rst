This command was originally inspired from and leveraged |pipdeptree|_.
However, if you would like to use ``pipdeptree`` for all installed Python
distributions, it is highly recommended to install ``pipdeptree`` with each
executable, which can be a bit fussy.

.. |pipdeptree| replace:: ``pipdeptree``
.. _pipdeptree: https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree
