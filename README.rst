``update``
----------

 ``update`` is a package manager written in Python 3.6 and Bash 3.2,
which automatically update all packages installed through ——

-  ``apm`` -- Atom packages

-  ``pip`` -- Python packages, in both version of 2.7 and 3.6, running
   under `CPython <https://www.python.org>`__ or
   `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__ compiler, and installed through ``brew``
   or official disk images

-  ``brew`` -- `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__ packages

-  ``cask`` -- `Caskroom <https://caskroom.github.io>`__ applications

-  ``appstore`` -- Mac App Store or ``softwareupdate`` installed
   applications

 You may install ``update`` through ``pip`` of Python (versions 3.\*).
And log files can be found in directory
``/Library/Logs/Scripts/update/``. The global man page for ``update``
shows as below.

.. code:: 

    $ update --help
    usage: update [-h] [-V] [-a] [-f] [-m] [-g] [-q] [-v] MODE ...

    Automatic Package Update Manager

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -V, --version  show program's version number and exit
      -a, --all      Update all packages installed through pip, Homebrew, and App
                     Store.
      -f, --force    Run in force mode, only for Homebrew or Caskroom.
      -m, --merge    Run in merge mode, only for Homebrew.
      -g, --greedy   Run in greedy mode, only for Caskroom.
      -q, --quiet    Run in quiet mode, with no output information.
      -v, --verbose  Run in verbose mode, with more information.

    mode selection:
      MODE           Update outdated packages installed through a specified
                     method, e.g.: apm, pip, brew, cask, or appstore.

 As it shows, there are five modes in total (if these commands exists).
To update all packages, you may use one of commands below.

.. code:: 

    $ update
    $ update -a
    $ update --all

1. ``apm`` -- Atom packages

 `Atom <https://atom.io>`__ provides a package manager called ``apm``,
i.e. "Atom Package Manager". The man page for ``update apm`` shows as
below.

.. code:: 

    $ update apm --help
    usage: update apm [-h] [-a] [-p PKG] [-q] [-v]

      -q, --quiet           Run in quiet mode, with no output information.
      -v, --verbose         Run in verbose mode, with more information.

 If arguments omit, ``update apm`` will update all outdated packages of

                            Postinstall procedure ends until which package, sort
                            in initial alphabets.
      -q, --quiet           Run in quiet mode, with no output information.
      -v, --verbose         Run in verbose mode, with detailed output information.

 As it shows, there is only one mode in total (if these commands
exists). To postinstall all packages, you may use one of commands below.

.. code:: 

    $ postinstall
    $ postinstall -a
    $ postinstall --all

 If arguments omit, ``postinstall`` will postinstall all installed
packages of Homebrew. And when using ``-p`` or ``--package``, if given
wrong package name, ``postinstall`` might give a trivial "did-you-mean"
correction.

``dependency``
--------------

 ``dependency`` is a package manager written in Python 3.6 and Bash 3.2,
which automatically and interactively show dependencies of packages
installed through ——

-  ``pip`` -- Python packages, in both version of 2.7 and 3.6, running
   under `CPython <https://www.python.org>`__ or
   `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__ compiler, and installed through ``brew``
   or official disk images

-  ``brew`` -- `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__ packages

 You may install ``dependency`` through ``pip`` of Python (versions
3.\*). And log files can be found in directory
``/Library/Logs/Scripts/dependency/``. The global man page for
``dependency`` shows as below.

.. code:: 

    $ dependency --help
    usage: dependency [-h] [-V] [-a] [-t] MODE ...

    Trivial Package Dependency Manager

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -V, --version  show program's version number and exit
      -a, --all      Show dependencies of all packages installed through pip and
                     Homebrew.
      -t, --tree     Show dependencies as a tree. This feature may request
                     `pipdeptree`.

    mode selection:
      MODE           Show dependencies of packages installed through a specified
                     method, e.g.: pip or brew.

 As it shows, there are two mode in total (if these commands exists).
The default procedure when arguments omit is to stand alone. To show
dependency of all packages, you may use one of commands below.

.. code:: 

    $ dependency -a
    $ dependency --all

1. ``pip`` -- Python packages

 As there\'re all kinds and versions of Python complier, along with its
``pip`` package manager. Here, we support showing dependency of
following ——

-  Python 2.7/3.6 installed through Python official disk images

-  Python 2.7/3.6 installed through ``brew install python/python3``

-  PyPy 2.7/3.5 installed through ``brew install pypy/pypy3``

And the man page shows as below.

.. code:: 

    $ dependency pip --help
    usage: dependency pip [-h] [-a] [-V VER] [-s] [-b] [-c] [-y] [-p PKG] [-t]

    Show dependencies of Python packages.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a, --all             Show dependencies of all packages installed through
                            pip.
      -V VER, --version VER
                            Indicate which version of pip will be updated.
      -s, --system          Show dependencies of pip packages on system level,
                            i.e. python installed through official installer.
      -b, --brew            Show dependencies of pip packages on Cellar level,
                            i.e. python installed through Homebrew.
      -c, --cpython         Show dependencies of pip packages on CPython
                            environment.
      -y, --pypy            Show dependencies of pip packages on PyPy environment.
      -p PKG, --package PKG
                            Name of packages to be shown, default is all.
      -t, --tree            Show dependencies as a tree. This feature requests
                            `pipdeptree`.

 If arguments omit, ``dependency pip`` will stand alone, and do nothing.
To show dependency of all packages, use ``-a`` or ``--all`` option. And
when using ``-p`` or ``--package``, if given wrong package name,
``dependency pip`` might give a trivial “did-you-mean” correction.

1. ``brew`` – Homebrew packages

 The man page for ``dependency brew`` shows as below.

.. code:: 

    $ dependency brew --help
    usage: dependency brew [-h] [-a] [-p PKG] [-t]

    Show dependencies of Homebrew packages.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a, --all             Show dependencies of all packages installed through
                            Homebrew.
      -p PKG, --package PKG
                            Name of packages to be shown, default is all.
      -t, --tree            Show dependencies as a tree.

 If arguments omit, ``dependency brew`` will stand alone, and do
nothing. To show dependency of all packages, use ``-a`` or ``--all``
option. And when using ``-p`` or ``--package``, if given wrong package
name, ``dependency brew`` might give a trivial “did-you-mean”
correction.
