About
-----

    Package day-care manager on macOS.

**MacDaily** is an all-in-one collection of console utility written in Python
with support of `PTY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal>`__.
Originally works as an automated housekeeper for Mac to update all packages
outdated, **MacDaily** is now fully functioned and end-user oriented.

**MacDaily** can manage packages of various distributions of
`Atom <https://atom.io>`__, `RubyGems <https://rubygems.org>`__,
`Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__, `Python <https://pypy.org>`__,
`Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`__, and even macOS software updates (c.f.
``softwareupdate(8)``). Without being aware of everything about your Mac, one
can easily work around and manage packages out of no pain using **MacDaily**.

Installation
------------

NB
    MacDaily runs only with support of Python from version **3.4**
    or higher. And it shall only work ideally on **macOS**.

.. raw:: html

    <h4>
      <a name="brew">
        MacDaily is now <code>brew</code>able üç∫
      </a>
    </h4>

Though not introduced to
`Homebrew core <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core>`__ database yet,
**MacDaily** is still available for ``brew``. Use the following commands to
add the `Tap <https://github.com/JarryShaw/homebrew-tap>`__ to your local
Homebrew installation (``$(BREW_PREFIX)/Homebrew/Library/Taps/``) and install
**MacDaily** through Homebrew.

.. code:: shell

    $ brew tap jarryshaw/tap
    $ brew install macdaily
    # or simply, a one-liner
    $ brew install jarryshaw/tap/macdaily

.. raw:: html

    <h4>
      <a name="pip">
        Legacy approach through <code>pip</code> üêç
      </a>
    </h4>

Just as many Python packages, MacDaily can be installed through
``pip`` using the following command, which will get you the latest
version from `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install macdaily

Or if you prefer the hard-core real-latest version and fetch from this GitHub
repository, then the script below should be used.

.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/JarryShaw/MacDaily.git
    $ cd MacDaily
    $ pip install -e .
    # and to update at any time
    $ git pull

Also, for best performance of MacDaily, the notable automation tool
|expect|_ is expected to be installed on your Mac. Recommended installation
approach is from `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__, as shown below.

.. code:: shell

    $ brew install expect

.. |expect| replace:: ``expect``
.. _expect: https://core.tcl.tk/expect

Or if you prefer not to install |expect|_, MacDaily will use
|UNIX script utility|_ instead. Make sure that ``/usr/bin/script``
exists and ``/usr/bin`` is in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

.. |UNIX script utility| replace:: UNIX ``script`` utility
.. _UNIX script utility: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unix)

For the worst case, MacDaily adopts |ptyng|_ as an alternative. It is
a revised version of |Python pty module|_, intended to support
pseudo-terminal (PTY) on macOS with no further issue. To install ``ptyng``,
you may use the script below.

.. |ptyng| replace:: ``ptyng``
.. _ptyng: https://github.com/JarryShaw/ptyng
.. |Python pty module| replace:: Python ``pty`` module
.. _Python pty module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install macdaily[ptyng]
    # or explicitly...
    $ pip install macdaily ptyng

For **tree** format support in ``dependency`` command, you will need
|dictdumper|_, then implicitly you can use the following script to do so.

.. |dictdumper| replace:: ``DictDumper``
.. _dictdumper: https://github.com/JarryShaw/DictDumper

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install macdaily[tree]
    # or explicitly...
    $ pip install macdaily dictdumper

And |configupdater|_ is required to support modification of the configuration
file in ``config`` command, since MacDaily intends to maintain the original
layout and information of original configuration file after modification. To
install, the sample script is as below.

.. |configupdater| replace:: ``ConfigUpdater``
.. _configupdater: https://configupdater.readthedocs.io

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install macdaily[config]
    # or explicitly...
    $ pip install macdaily configupdater

To install all requirements for full support of MacDaily, you may simply run
the following script when installation.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install macdaily[all]
    # or explicitly...
    $ pip install macdaily configupdater dictdumper ptyng

Configuration
-------------

    This part might be kind of garrulous, for some may not know what's
    going on here. üòâ

Since robust enough, MacDaily now supports configuration upon
user's own wish. One may set up log path, hard disk path, archive path
and many other things, other than the default settings.

NB
    MacDaily now supports configuration commands,
    see manual of |config|_ command for more information.

The configuration file should lie under ``~/.dailyrc``, which is hidden
from Finder by macOS. To review or edit it, you may use text editors
like ``vim`` and/or ``nano``, or other graphic editors, such as Sublime
Text and/or Visual Studio Code, or whatever you find favourable.

.. code:: ini

    [Path]
    # In this section, paths for log files are specified.
    # Please, under any circumstances, make sure they are valid.
    logdir = ~/Library/Logs/MacDaily                            ; path where logs will be stored

Above is the default content of ``.dailyrc``, following the grammar of
``INI`` files. Lines and words after number sign (``#``) and semicolon
(``;``) are comments, whose main purpose is to help understanding the
contents of this file.

In section ``Path``, there are path names where logs and some other
things to be stored. In section ``Mode``, there are ten different
modes to indicate if they are *enabled* or *disabled*.

You may wish to set the ``dskdir`` -- *path where your hard disk lies*,
which allows MacDaily to archive your ancient logs and caches into
somewhere never bothers.

Please **NOTE** that, under all circumstances, of section ``Path``,
all values would better be a **valid path name**, possibly with ``~``
user-home expansion.

Besides, in section ``Daemon``, you can decide which command is
scheduled and when to run such command, with the format of
``HH:MM[-CMD]``. The ``CMD`` is optional, which will be ``any`` if
omits. And you may set up which command(s) will be registered as daemons
and run with schedule through booleans above. These boolean values
help MacDaily indicate which is to be launched when commands in
schedule omit. That is to say, when ``CMD`` omits in schedule, MacDaily
will register all commands that set ``true`` in the above boolean values.

Also, in section ``Option``, you may set up optional arguments for
the daemons above. Do please make sure these commands are **valid**. And
if omit, the help command ``--help`` will be given.

Last but no least, in section ``Miscellaneous``, you should **NEVER**
modify any contents under this section in order to keep MacDaily
working. However, you may set up this part with |config|_ command.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Where can I find the log files?
    It depends. Since the path where logs go can be modified through
    ``~/.dailyrc``, it may vary as your settings. In default, you may
    find them under ``~/Library/Logs/Scripts``. And with every command,
    logs can be found in its corresponding folder. Logs are named after
    its running time, in the fold with corresponding date as its name.

    Note that, normally, you can only find today's logs in the folder,
    since ``macdaily`` automatically archive ancient logs into
    ``${logdir}/arcfile`` folder. And every week, ``${logdir}/arcfile``
    folder will be tape-archived into ``${logdir}/tarfile``. Then after a
    month, and your hard disk available, they will be moved into
    ``/Volumes/Your Disk/Developers/archive.zip``.

2. What if my hard disk ain't plugged-in when running the scripts?
    Then the archiving and removing procedure will **NOT** perform. In
    case there might be some useful resources of yours.

3. Which directory should I set in the configuration file?
    First and foremost, I highly recommend you **NOT** to modify the
    paths in ``~/.dailyrc`` manually, **EXCEPT** your disk path
    ``dskdir``.

    But if you insist to do so, then make sure they are **VALID**, possibly
    with ``~`` user-home expansion and most importantly, they must be
    **available** with permission granted.

TODO
----

- ‚úîÔ∏è support configuration
- ‚úîÔ∏è support command aliases
- ‚úîÔ∏è reconstruct archiving procedure
- ‚ùå support ``gem`` and ``npm`` in all commands
- ‚úîÔ∏è considering support more versions of Python
- ‚úîÔ∏è optimise ``KeyboardInterrupt`` handling procedure
- ‚ùå implement further specifications for package indication mini-language
- ‚úîÔ∏è review ``pip`` implementation and version indication
- ‚úîÔ∏è add ``--user`` for ``pip`` commands
- ‚ùå implement ``bundle`` and ``help`` commands
