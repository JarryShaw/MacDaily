### Archive Procedure

```
$ macdaily archive
```

&emsp; The `archive` command will move all ancient logs to where it belongs --

 - daily logs from last week (7 days) -- `${logdir}/archive` with corresponding modes named as `YYMMDD.tar.gz`
 - weekly archives from last month (approximately 4 weeks) -- `${logdir}/tarfile` with corresponding modes named as `YYMMDD-YYMMDD.tar.bz`
 - even older logs -- inside `${arcdir}/archive.zip` with corresponding modes and named as `YYMMDD-YYMMDD.tar.xz`

Actual paths of `${logdir}` and `${arcdir}` are defined in `~/.dailyrc`, may vary from your own settings.

### Config Procedure

```
$ macdaily config
Entering interactive command line setup procedure...
Default settings are shown as in the square brackets.
Please directly ENTER if you prefer the default settings.

For logging utilities, we recommend you to set up your hard disk path.
You may change other path preferences in configuration `~/.dailyrc` later.
Please note that all paths must be valid under all circumstances.
Name of your hard disk []:

In default, we will run update and logging commands twice a day.
You may change daily commands preferences in configuration `~/.dailyrc` later.
Please enter schedule as HH:MM[-CMD] format, and each separates with comma.
Time for daily scripts [8:00,22:30-update,23:00-logging]:

To make sure the daemons will launch as expected, we will record your account information.
You must not modify the information generated by MacDaily.
Please enter your login password, and we will keep it in a safe place.

```

&emsp; As shown above, the `config` command will help modify `~/.dailyrc`. For more information on `~/.dailyrc`, please refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/JarryShaw/MacDaily#configuration) section.

&nbsp;

<a name="launch"> </a>

### Launch Procedure

```
$ macdaily launch
```

&emsp; The `launch` command will reload `~/.dailyrc` and register daemons to `Launch Agents` on macOS. After manually modified  `[Daemon]` section on `~/.dailyrc`, it is mandatory to run the `launch` command to activate these settings.

&nbsp;
